  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p><i>“A gaming community for all kinds of games”</i>
<br>
<br>
Our motto in UNS is “A gaming community for all kinds of games” which means that the community goal is that everyone should be able to socialise with everyone, and that’s why we don’t have closed game channels on our TeamSpeak. This is to prevent bullying, but also for us to stay together. Although we try to stay together as much as possible we always welcome new members!
<br>
<br>
Feel free to make a contribution to the community; donate, become a member or invite your friends so that we can grow, improve our servers and more. It’s always appreciated!</p>
